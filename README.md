# Shared Wallet.sol
Created this for a lab exercise in a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/blockchain-developer/) I bought for Solidity/Blockchain development created by:

- [Thomas Weisner](https://github.com/tomw1808)
- [Ravinder Deol](https://www.ravinderdeol.com/)
- Martin Sterlicchi

The goal of this project is to create a shared wallet/contract that the owner can deposit ethereum into and people can request to withdraw ethereum from. 

I was told to code it up on my own so all code you see is made by me. I added or will add a few features that I feel like would be pretty cool for this project (because why not). You can run my code here, I hope you enjoy it :).
